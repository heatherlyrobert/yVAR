.TH yVAR_regexи 3 2008-jul "linux" "interfacing with full library version"

.SH NAME
yVAR \- simple, consistent, reusable variable testing services

.SH PATRON
keres-psychostasia (judgement) spirits of violent death, choosing righteous

.SH IMAGERY
fanged, taloned women in bloody garments, flying over the battlefield

.SH SUMMARY (see yVAR (7) for more information)
yVAR is a set of shared functions for variable existance, typing, and value
testing services for use by the calling program, making a tedious and neglected
task into a systematic, shared, easy to maintain, and safer one.

.SH SERIOUS FOREWARNING
i am a crazy, selfish, dog-fooding c-programmer.  my code tends to be
experimental and constantly evolving.  my point is NOT to be the best, it is
to challenge myself, build from scratch, and allow fast problem solving.

b) synopsis        function overview
c) tests           specific tests provided
d) results         return codes

.SH A) OVERVIEW
yVAR_regex follows the same general guidelines as all others, except it is
focused on character strings and comparing the to standard or custom regular
expressions.

.SH B) SYNOPSIS
char     yVAR_regex   (char* <test>, char* <expect>, char* <actual>)
char     yVAR_regexs  (char* <test>, char* <actual>)

.SH C) TESTS
tests are requested by their name (not number) being passed in the <test>
arguement.  they all being with "s_" to make using them in koios (unit testing)
more clear.  in testing, s_equal is +95% of the usage.

expected strings can include a mask character (г) to not compare a specific
character location, or perhaps many.

additionally, in koios (unit-testing) usage, the "s_" prefix can be replaced by
"w_" and the strings will be shown with т...Т wrappers to confirm length.

.SH D) RESULTS
the return code is a little intelligent to help with testing the yVAR_int
function itself.  but, there are three meaningful returns...
   pos    matches requested test
   neg    fails requested test
   ?      means unknown test

.SH BUGS
yENV is incredibly stable for me, but if anyone else used it it might explode
and take the universe with it.

.SH COLOPHON
this page is part of a documentation package meant to make the use of the
heatherly tools easier and faster
