.SH NAME
yVAR \- simple, consistent, reusable variable testing services

.SH PATRON
keres-psychostasia (judgement) spirits of violent death, choosing righteous

.SH IMAGERY
fanged, taloned women in bloody garments, flying over the battlefield

.SH SUMMARY (see yVAR (7) for more information)
yVAR is a set of shared functions for variable existance, typing, and value
testing services for use by the calling program, making a tedious and neglected
task into a systematic, shared, easy to maintain, and safer one.

.SH SERIOUS FOREWARNING
i am a crazy, selfish, dog-fooding c-programmer.  my code tends to be
experimental and constantly evolving.  my point is NOT to be the best, it is
to challenge myself, build from scratch, and allow fast problem solving.

.SH A) OVERVIEW
yVAR_string follows the same general guidelines as all others, except it is
focused on character strings.

.SH B) SYNOPSIS
char     yVAR_string  (char* <test>, char* <expect>, char* <actual>)
char     yVAR_strs    (char* <test>, char* <actual>)

.SH C) TESTS
tests are requested by their name (not number) being passed in the <test>
arguement.  they all being with "s_" to make using them in koios (unit testing)
more clear.  in testing, s_equal is +95% of the usage.

expected strings can include a mask character (¬) to not compare a specific
character location, or perhaps many.

additionally, in koios (unit-testing) usage, the "s_" prefix can be replaced by
"w_" and the strings will be shown with å...æ wrappers to confirm length.

---·--···---name---···---description---------------------------------
Ï   1    s_equal      expected and actual match
·   2    s_not        expected and actual are not the same
·   3    s_greater    actual sorts greater than expected
·   4    s_gequal     actual sorts greater than (or equal to) expected
·   5    s_lesser     actual sorts lesser than expected
·   6    s_lequal     actual sorts lesser than (or equal to) expected

·>  7    s_empty      actual is an empty string
·>  8    s_exists     actual is not empty
·   9    s_length     actual is a specific length

.SS sub-set
.nf
-···--···--name---····---description---------------------------------
·   10   s_sub        expected is a substr of actual
·   11   s_super      actual is a substr of expected
·   12   s_entry      expected is in comma delimited actual string

.SH D) RESULTS
the return code is a little intelligent to help with testing the yVAR_int
function itself.  but, there are three meaningful returns...
   pos    matches requested test
   neg    fails requested test
   ?      means unknown test

.SH BUGS
yENV is incredibly stable for me, but if anyone else used it it might explode
and take the universe with it.

.SH COLOPHON
this page is part of a documentation package meant to make the use of the
heatherly tools easier and faster
